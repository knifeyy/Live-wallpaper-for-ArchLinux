# Using Manjaro Linux.
Feel free to update!

## Step 1
Install pygame on your system to run the .py file 

## Step 2
Execute the following on terminal to run the script as wallpaper :
pamac build xwinwrap-git   

## Step 3
Now run the bash file and execute the following : 
chmod +x /path/to/your/file//start_particle_wallpaper.sh

## Note
To make this permanent : 
For KDE Plasma, you can do this via "System Settings" -> "Startup and Shutdown" -> "Autostart" and then add the bash .sh file here.
Reboot your system to test.
